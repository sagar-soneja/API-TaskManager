# CLI Commands REST API (Task Manager)
API Link :- https://task-manager-ssoneja.herokuapp.com (if it's down it means I unfortunately ran out of my Free Credits)
#### It is Task-Manager-API which is used to create user and its tasks using CRUD operations. ### The purpose of this project is to learn and practice concepts related to:
> - Building a REST API
> - NodeJS
> - Express
> - JWT
> - Testing (JEST)

#### More specifically, I used the following:
> - NodeJS and Express for creating end points
> - MongoDB Server For Database 
> - RESTful API guidelines
> - HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, status codes)
> - JWT Authentication 
> - Testing API Endpoints (Postman)
> - Heroku (Deployment)
> - Jest and SuperTest (Testing)
> - Version control with Git

### How to use :-
> - Install Postman( https://www.postman.com/ )
> - In Postman :- 
> - - Create collection name as Task App (or as u want), then go in edit :-

Then in Authorization change Type as Bearer Token and Token as {{authToken}}

Then Before making every Request change its Test to :-

and its Authorization to :-

All of the above setting will save you from putting user id for authentication again and again in request api
